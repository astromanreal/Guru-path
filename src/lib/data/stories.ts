    { id: "s01", title: "Shankara and the Chandala", guruId: "adi-shankaracharya", anecdote: "Once, while walking in Varanasi, Adi Shankaracharya encountered a chandala (an outcaste) accompanied by four dogs, symbolizing the four Vedas. When his disciples asked the man to move aside, the chandala challenged Shankara, asking, 'Whom are you asking to move? The body, or the Atman? The Atman is one and indivisible.' Shankara instantly realized this was Lord Shiva himself testing his understanding of non-duality. In that moment of profound insight, he composed the 'Manisha Panchakam,' five verses declaring that anyone with the true knowledge of Brahman is a worthy guru, regardless of birth." },
    { id: "s02", title: "Vivekananda's Test", guruId: "swami-vivekananda", anecdote: "The rational, young Vivekananda initially doubted Sri Ramakrishna's divine states. To break through his intellectual barriers, Ramakrishna once called him close and, with a simple touch of his foot to Vivekananda's chest, unleashed a torrent of spiritual energy. The room, the walls, and everything around him began to dissolve into a single, universal consciousness. This powerful transmission shattered Vivekananda's skepticism and established his unwavering faith in his master's spiritual authority, preparing him for his future mission." },
    { id: "s03", title: "Ramana's Death Experience", guruId: "ramana-maharshi", anecdote: "At the age of 16, a sudden, intense fear of death seized the young Venkataraman. Instead of panicking, he lay down and decided to investigate death directly. He held his breath and imagined his body being carried to the cremation ground and burned to ashes. Yet, he remained keenly aware of a witnessing consciousness, the 'I', that was untouched by the body's demise. In this profound self-enquiry, he realized his true nature as the deathless, eternal Self. This spontaneous awakening transformed him into the sage, Ramana Maharshi." },
    { id: "s04", title: "Yogananda and the Scentless Roses", guruId: "paramahansa-yogananda", anecdote: "To demonstrate the power of mind over matter, Yogananda's guru, Sri Yukteswar, pointed to a vase of scentless roses and asked him to make them fragrant. After a period of intense concentration, focusing on the subtle 'lifetrons' or intelligent energy that constitute all things, Yogananda succeeded. The fragrance bloomed from the flowers, proving the yogic principle that consciousness is the underlying reality and can influence the material world. It was a lesson not in miracles, but in the scientific application of universal laws." },
    { id: "s05", title: "Kalpataru Day", guruId: "sri-ramakrishna", anecdote: "On January 1, 1886, a very ill Sri Ramakrishna felt a surge of divine power. He gathered his householder disciples and, in a state of god-consciousness, declared, 'What more shall I say? May you all be blessed!' He then touched each disciple, granting them profound spiritual experiences, from deep peace to visions of their chosen deities. This event, known as Kalpataru Day, marked a moment of collective spiritual awakening and is celebrated by devotees to this day." },
    { id: "s06", title: "Aurobindo's Prison Realization", guruId: "sri-aurobindo", anecdote: "While imprisoned by the British in Alipore Jail, Sri Aurobindo was in deep despair. One day, during meditation, the walls of his cell seemed to vanish. He saw Lord Krishna (as Vasudeva) everywhere—in the prisoners, the guards, the bars of his cell, and the tree outside his window. He heard a divine voice assuring him, 'I am guiding you. I have brought you here to give you my work.' This profound experience of cosmic consciousness shifted his focus from political revolution to spiritual evolution for humanity." },
    { id: "s07", title: "Prabhupada on the Jaladuta", guruId: "prabhupada", anecdote: "In 1965, at the age of 69, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada journeyed to America aboard the cargo ship Jaladuta. The voyage was perilous, and he suffered two heart attacks. Fearing he might not survive, he had a vivid dream in which Lord Krishna himself appeared, captaining the ship and encouraging him to continue. This mystical assurance gave him the strength and conviction that his mission to spread Krishna consciousness in the West was divinely sanctioned and would be successful." },
    { id: "s08", title: "Totaka’s Awakening", guruId: "adi-shankaracharya", anecdote: "Totaka, one of the four principal disciples of Adi Shankaracharya, was initially perceived as slow. One day, Shankara waited for him before starting a discourse. The other disciples grew impatient, but Shankara saw Totaka's hidden potential. Inspired by devotion, Totaka spontaneously composed the complex 'Totakashtakam' in perfect Sanskrit meter, astounding everyone. It was a divine revelation that true devotion transcends intellectual barriers and that a guru's grace can awaken hidden genius." },

He told his disciple Yogananda that these would accelerate spiritual hunger and push humanity toward a higher cycle of consciousness. His words proved true with World Wars I and II, followed by a global interest in yoga and spirituality, reflecting the prophetic insight of yogic masters into cosmic time cycles (Yugas)." },
    { id: "s11", title: "Ramakrishna and the Sword of Kali", guruId: "sri-ramakrishna", anecdote: "One night, in desperation for a vision of the Divine Mother, Sri Ramakrishna decided to end his life. As he reached for a sword in the Kali temple, the Divine Mother Kali manifested before him as an ocean of radiant consciousness, flooding his being with bliss. From that day forward, Ramakrishna lived in a state of constant communion with the Divine, a dramatic moment marking his transformation into one of India's greatest mystics." },

That spot later became the Matrimandir—the soul of Auroville. Her silent communication with nature and her vision for a unified humanity were encoded in this intuitive moment, revealing the subtle spiritual foundation of Auroville." },

    { id: "s15", title: "Shankara and the Crocodile", guruId: "adi-shankaracharya", anecdote: "As a young boy, Shankara wished to become a monk, but his mother refused. One day while bathing in a river, a crocodile seized his leg. Shankara cried out, ‘If you let me take sannyasa, the crocodile will release me!’ His mother, terrified, agreed. Instantly, the crocodile let go. Interpreting this as divine sanction, he renounced worldly life and began his mission." },
    { id: "s16", title: "Ramakrishna and the Islam Experience", guruId: "sri-ramakrishna", anecdote: "With a Muslim fakir’s help, Sri Ramakrishna adopted Islamic practices with full sincerity.
