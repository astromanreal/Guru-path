    name: "Advaita Vedanta",
    description: "The non-dualistic tradition, famously consolidated by Adi Shankaracharya. He systematized its teachings through his masterful commentaries on the Upanishads, Brahma Sutras, and Bhagavad Gita. By establishing four monastic centers (mathas) in the corners of India, he created an enduring organizational structure for the preservation and propagation of Vedanta. The core teaching is that the true Self (Atman) is identical to the ultimate reality (Brahman).",

    description: "A modern interpretation of Vedanta that blends Advaita's metaphysics with the devotional fervor of Bhakti and the selfless action of Karma Yoga.

    description: "A direct path to realization focused on the practice of Self-Enquiry (Atma-vichara), as taught by the sage of Arunachala, Sri Ramana Maharshi. The method involves persistently turning attention to the source of the 'I'-thought to dissolve the ego and abide as the Self. Silence is considered a primary teaching.
